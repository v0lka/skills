# Specification System

This document defines the format, rules, and procedures for creating and maintaining project specifications. It is the source of truth for how specs are structured.

## Purpose

Specifications provide AI coding agents with deterministic context about system behavior, interfaces, and architectural decisions. They enable agents to make safe, informed changes without extensive codebase exploration.

## Principles

1. **Self-standing documents** — specs are NOT generated from code. They describe intended behavior; a discrepancy between spec and code indicates a bug (in the code or the spec — determine by context).
2. **Agent-optimized** — predictable structure, explicit cross-references, no filler prose. Every section has a purpose.
3. **Living documents** — updated after code changes that alter documented behavior. Never silently drifting.
4. **Domain-based** — organized by conceptual domains, NOT by file/directory structure.
5. **Contracts are first-class** — cross-boundary interfaces deserve their own documents.

## Naming Conventions

- Files: `kebab-case.md`
- Directories within `domains/`: created when a domain requires multiple files
- `README.md` inside a domain directory: overview and entry point for that domain
- `_template.md` prefix: template files (not actual specs)
- ADR files: `NNN-kebab-case-slug.md` (three-digit number, kebab-case slug)

## Document Formats

### Domain README (`domains/*/README.md` or `domains/*.md`)

Required sections in order:

```markdown
# [Domain Name]

## Purpose

1-3 sentences. What this domain does in the system.

## Key Files

- `path/from/repo/root/file.ext` — role description

## Core Types

Key type definitions (code blocks) with brief explanations.

## Flow

ASCII diagram or numbered sequence showing the primary happy path.

## Invariants

Bullet list of properties that ALWAYS hold. Use affirmative phrasing.

## Configuration

Key parameters from configuration with defaults and valid values.

## Extension Points

How to add new behavior without breaking existing functionality.

## Related Specs

- [link](relative/path.md) — context of relationship
```

### Domain Detail (`domains/*/<name>.md`)

For individual components within a domain:

```markdown
# [Component Name]

## Role

1 sentence: what this component does within its domain.

## Key Files

- `path/to/file.ext` — description

## Behavior

Detailed description. May include:
- State machines (ASCII)
- Decision tables
- Pseudocode
- Sequence diagrams

## Error Handling

How this component handles and propagates errors.

## Invariants

Properties that always hold for this component.

## Related Specs

- [link](relative/path.md) — relationship context
```

### Contract (`contracts/*.md`)

```markdown
# Contract: [Layer A] <-> [Layer B]

## Boundary Rule

One sentence: direction of dependency and what is NOT allowed.

## Interfaces

| Interface | Package | Consumed By | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |

## Initialization

How components are wired together at startup.

## Data Flow Across Boundary

What data crosses the boundary, in what form, in which direction.

## Error Propagation

Rules for wrapping/transforming errors at this boundary.

## Breaking Change Checklist

If you change X, you MUST also update Y.
```

### Architecture (`architecture/*.md`)

```markdown
# [Topic]

## Context

Why this architectural aspect matters.

## [Main Content]

Diagrams, rules, descriptions. Structure varies by topic.

## Invariants

Architectural rules that must never be violated.

## Anti-Patterns

What NOT to do, with brief explanation of why.
```

### ADR (`decisions/NNN-slug.md`)

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Title]

## Status

Accepted | Superseded by [NNN](./NNN-slug.md)

## Context

The problem or question that required a decision.

## Decision

What was decided.

## Consequences

Positive and negative impacts on the codebase.

## Alternatives Considered

What was evaluated and why it was rejected.
```

## Cross-References

- Always use relative paths from `specs/` directory
- Format: `[display text](relative/path.md)`
- For intra-file section references: `[display text](relative/path.md#section-name)` (lowercase, hyphens)
- When referencing source code: backtick path from repo root, e.g. `src/core/router.go`

## Update Protocol

### When to update specs

- After any change that alters documented behavior
- After adding/removing/renaming interfaces that appear in a contract
- After changing architectural boundaries or invariants
- After making a new architectural decision (create ADR)

### How to update

1. Read the current spec fully before modifying
2. Preserve the document format (sections, ordering) defined in this META.md
3. Update cross-references if file paths changed
4. After adding or removing a spec file, update `INDEX.md`
5. ADRs with `Status: Accepted` are immutable; create a new ADR to supersede

### Validation checklist

- [ ] All sections from the template are present
- [ ] Cross-references point to existing files
- [ ] Code paths in Key Files are accurate
- [ ] Invariants are stated affirmatively
- [ ] INDEX.md reflects the current file set
